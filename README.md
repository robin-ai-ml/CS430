# CS430
Implements an iterative depth-first search on a graph using a stack.

This iterative DFS matches the behavior of a recursive DFS traversal, 
ensuring each node is visited only once by keeping track of nodes 
already visited.

A dictionary tracks the parent of each node to represent the DFS 
forest. The same DFS order and forest structure as recursive DFS is 
generated.
